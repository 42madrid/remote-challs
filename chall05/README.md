_"I before E except after C"_ is perhaps the most famous English spelling rule. For the purpose of this challenge, the rule says:

if "ei" appears in a word, it must immediately follow "c".

If "ie" appears in a word, it must not immediately follow "c".

A word also follows the rule if neither "ei" nor "ie" appears anywhere in the word. Examples of words that follow this rule are:

```
fiery hierarchy hieroglyphic
ceiling inconceivable receipt
daily programmer one two three
```

There are many exceptions that don't follow this rule, such as:

```
sleigh stein fahrenheit
deifies either nuclei reimburse
ancient juicier societies
```

Write a function that tells you whether or not a given word follows the "I before E except after C" rule.

### Examples

```
ft_ie_except_after_c("a") == 1
ft_ie_except_after_c("zombie") == 1
ft_ie_except_after_c("transceiver") == 1
ft_ie_except_after_c("veil") == 0
ft_ie_except_after_c("icier") == 0
```
